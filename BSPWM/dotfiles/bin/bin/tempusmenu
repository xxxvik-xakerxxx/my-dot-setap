# tempusmenu: a dmenu script to switch between Tempus themes.
# `tempusmenu` invokes a script that executes the actual theme change.

# PREREQUISITES
# All of my dotfiles (stow everything)
# https://github.com/protesilaos/dotfiles

# define length of tempus themes list (for use in dmenu -l)
tempus_themes_length=$(ls $HOME/.my_Xcolors/tempus/ | wc -l)

# pass custom colours to dmenu command
source $HOME/.my_Xcolors/active-tempus-theme.sh

# dmenu wrapper with the list of tempus themes
tempus_themes_selection()
{
    ls $HOME/.my_Xcolors/tempus/ | \
    sed 's/\([a-z]*_\)\([a-z]*\)\(\.[a-zA-Z]*\)/\2 /g' | \
    dmenu -l $tempus_themes_length -p 'Select Tempus theme' -nb $background -nf $foreground -sb $color5 -sf $background -fn 'DejaVu Sans Mono-12'
}

# capture dmenu output
tempus_themes_choice=$(tempus_themes_selection)

# run script to update all themes with the choice as its argument
if [ $tempus_themes_choice ]; then
    own_script_update_environment_theme $tempus_themes_choice
fi


# ANNEX with further explanations

# I store my generic X colors in $HOME/.my_Xcolors/.
# The tempus themes are within the subdirectory $HOME/.my_Xcolors/tempus/.
# Each item's name is prefixed with 'tempus_' and suffixed with '.Xcolors'.

# $ ls $HOME/.my_Xcolors/tempus/
# tempus_autumn.Xcolors  tempus_rift.Xcolors    tempus_warp.Xcolors
# tempus_fugit.Xcolors   tempus_spring.Xcolors  tempus_winter.Xcolors
# tempus_future.Xcolors  tempus_summer.Xcolors
# tempus_past.Xcolors    tempus_totus.Xcolors

# The sed regex is used to omit the prefix 'tempus_' and the suffix '.Xcolors'.
# $ ls $HOME/.my_Xcolors/tempus/ | sed 's/\([a-z]*_\)\([a-z]*\)\(\.[a-zA-Z]*\)/\2 /g'
# autumn
# fugit
# future
# past
# rift
# spring
# summer
# totus
# warp
# winter

# This is needed to pass the corect argument to the `own_script_update_environment_theme`.
# That script, as with all of my scripts, is stored in my dotfiles, under `bin`.
