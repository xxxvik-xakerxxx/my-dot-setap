# EXPERIMENTAL !!!

# Applies theme change to all active terminals that read X colours. `urxvtc` in my case.
# Adapted from https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/80nidw/bspwm_script_to_change_all_themes_on_demand/duxjw1e/
# My changes apply to the broadening of the query's scope. My X colours are not set specifically for URxvt.
